    Objective: Help me to develop a django web app called Subby.It should help people with hearing loss by providing real-time speech-to-text transcription.  Create a Django web application named Subby for live transcription. we Use Bluetooth lavalier microphones to transcribe speech to text in real-time. we Use the Deepgram API for live transcription rather than file upload. we Set the default language for the API to Dutch. we Show the transcript moving on the screen as a teleprompter on the app interface. we Allow the app user to adjust the font size. we Allow the app user to pick a language other than Dutch from the following options: English, German, French, Italian, and Swedish. we Edit the transcript for readability and ease of understanding, rather than being a verbatim transcription. (think about nltk or something?) screen mode should be horizontal, and the transcript should move on the screen as a teleprompter. I wish we could also make a button to quick show a summary of what's transcribed in the last 60 seconds. But if this is very complicated, please skip. The idea is that Subby comes with a charging case that includes 5 clip-on Bluetooth lavalier microphones. We can't do that now but we can think about bluetooth function. Thank you for taking on this project and helping to make a positive impact on the lives of people with hearing loss. 
  <code>

    
    Here's an example of step 1, which involves creating a Django web application named "Subby":

    Step 1
    
    '''
    # subby_project/urls.py
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.home, name='home'),
        # Add more paths for other views or functionality
    ]
    
    # subby_project/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    
    def home(request):
        return render(request, 'home.html')
    '''
    
    In this example, we define a Django project named "subby_project" with a single URL pattern. The URL pattern maps the root URL to the home view function. The home function renders the home.html template, which will serve as the starting point for the application.
    
    
    Step 2: 
    
    
    Integrate Bluetooth lavalier microphones with the application to capture speech input in real-time.
    
    To integrate Bluetooth lavalier microphones with the application, you would need to use appropriate libraries or modules that provide Bluetooth functionality. Depending on the programming language you are using, there may be specific libraries available for handling Bluetooth communication. You would need to connect to the microphones and capture the speech input from them.
    
    Example code for integrating Bluetooth lavalier microphones will vary depending on the specific programming language and libraries being used. Here's an example in Python using the pybluez library:
    
    '''
    import bluetooth
    
    # Discover nearby Bluetooth devices
    devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
    
    # Select the Bluetooth lavalier microphone from the discovered devices
    selected_device = None
    for device in devices:
        if 'Lavalier Microphone' in bluetooth.lookup_name(device):
            selected_device = device
            break
    
    # Connect to the selected microphone
    socket = bluetooth.BluetoothSocket(bluetooth.RFCOMM)
    socket.connect((selected_device, 1))
    
    # Start capturing speech input from the microphone
    while True:
        data = socket.recv(1024)
        # Process the received data (e.g., send it for transcription)
    
    # Close the Bluetooth connection when done
    socket.close()
    '''
    
    Please note that this is a simplified example and the specific implementation will depend on the libraries and tools you choose to use.
    
    Step 3: 
    
    Utilize the Deepgram API to perform live transcription of the captured speech. Make sure to configure the API to use the Dutch language as the default.
    
    To utilize the Deepgram API for live transcription, you would need to sign up for an account and obtain the necessary API credentials. You can then make HTTP requests to the Deepgram API, sending the captured speech data for transcription. Make sure to configure the API request to specify the Dutch language for the transcription.
    
    Here's an example code snippet in Python using the requests library to make the API call:
    
    '''
    import requests
    
    # Set up the Deepgram API endpoint and API key
    api_endpoint = 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/realtime'
    api_key = 'your_api_key'
    
    # Set the desired transcription language (Dutch in this case)
    language = 'nl'
    
    # Send the captured speech data for transcription
    def transcribe_speech(audio_data):
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
        }
        params = {
            'language': language
        }
        response = requests.post(api_endpoint, headers=headers, params=params, data=audio_data)
        # Process the transcription response
    
    # Call the transcribe_speech function with the captured audio data
    transcribe_speech(audio_data)
    '''
    
    Remember to replace 'your_api_key' with your actual Deepgram API key.
    
    Step 4: 
    
    Develop the app interface to display the transcription as a moving teleprompter on the screen. Implement the necessary logic to ensure that the transcript continuously updates as new speech is transcribed.
    
    To develop the app interface, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web-based interface that displays the transcription as a moving teleprompter. You would need to continuously update the transcript as new speech is transcribed.
    
    Example code for a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript teleprompter interface:
    
    '''
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subby Teleprompter</title>
        <style>
            .teleprompter {
                height: 200px;
                overflow-y: scroll;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="teleprompter" id="transcript"></div>
    
        <script>
            // Function to continuously update the transcript
            function updateTranscript(transcription) {
                var transcriptDiv = document.getElementById('transcript');
                transcriptDiv.innerHTML = transcription;
                transcriptDiv.scrollTop = transcriptDiv.scrollHeight;
            }
    
            // Example usage: update the transcript with new speech
            var newSpeech = 'This is the new transcription.';
            updateTranscript(newSpeech);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''
    
    In this example, we have an HTML file with a <div> element that represents the teleprompter area. The JavaScript code includes a function updateTranscript that updates the content of the <div> element with the provided transcription and ensures that the scroll position is at the bottom.
    
    Step 5:
    
    Provide options for the app user to adjust the font size of the teleprompter text. This can be achieved through user interface controls or settings.
    
    To provide font size options to the user, you can add UI controls such as buttons or a dropdown menu that allow the user to select the desired font size. You can use JavaScript to listen for changes in the selected font size and update the teleprompter accordingly.
    
    Example code for adding font size options:
    
    '''
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subby Teleprompter</title>
        <style>
            .teleprompter {
                height: 200px;
                overflow-y: scroll;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="teleprompter" id="transcript"></div>
    
        <label for="font-size">Font Size:</label>
        <select id="font-size">
            <option value="small">Small</option>
            <option value="medium" selected>Medium</option>
            <option value="large">Large</option>
        </select>
    
        <script>
            // Function to continuously update the transcript
            function updateTranscript(transcription) {
                var transcriptDiv = document.getElementById('transcript');
                transcriptDiv.innerHTML = transcription;
                transcriptDiv.scrollTop = transcriptDiv.scrollHeight;
            }
    
            // Function to handle changes in font size selection
            function handleFontSizeChange() {
                var selectedFontSize = document.getElementById('font-size').value;
                var transcriptDiv = document.getElementById('transcript');
                transcriptDiv.style.fontSize = selectedFontSize;
            }
    
            // Example usage: update the transcript with new speech
            var newSpeech = 'This is the new transcription.';
            updateTranscript(newSpeech);
    
            // Add event listener for font size change
            document.getElementById('font-size').addEventListener('change', handleFontSizeChange);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''
    
    In this example, we have added a <select> element with different font size options. The handleFontSizeChange function is called whenever the font size selection changes, updating the font size of the teleprompter text accordingly.
    
    Step 6: 
    
    '''
    Implement language selection functionality, allowing the user to choose a language other than Dutch from the available options (English, German, French, Italian, and Swedish).
    
    To implement language selection functionality, you can add UI controls such as a dropdown menu or radio buttons that allow the user to select the desired language. You will need to handle the user's language selection and update the Deepgram API configuration accordingly.
    
    Example code for adding language selection functionality:
    
    📋 Copy code
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subby Teleprompter</title>
        <style>
            .teleprompter {
                height: 200px;
                overflow-y: scroll;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="teleprompter" id="transcript"></div>
    
        <label for="language">Language:</label>
        <select id="language">
            <option value="nl" selected>Dutch</option>
            <option value="en">English</option>
            <option value="de">German</option>
            <option value="fr">French</option>
            <option value="it">Italian</option>
            <option value="sv">Swedish</option>
        </select>
    
        <script>
            // Function to continuously update the transcript
            function updateTranscript(transcription) {
                var transcriptDiv = document.getElementById('transcript');
                transcriptDiv.innerHTML = transcription;
                transcriptDiv.scrollTop = transcriptDiv.scrollHeight;
            }
    
            // Function to handle changes in language selection
            function handleLanguageChange() {
                var selectedLanguage = document.getElementById('language').value;
                // Update the Deepgram API configuration with the selected language
                // ...
            }
    
            // Example usage: update the transcript with new speech
            var newSpeech = 'This is the new transcription.';
            updateTranscript(newSpeech);
    
            // Add event listener for language change
            document.getElementById('language').addEventListener('change', handleLanguageChange);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''
    
    In this example, we have added a <select> element with different language options. The handleLanguageChange function is called whenever the language selection changes, and you would need to update the Deepgram API configuration with the selected language.
    
    Step 7: 
    
    
    Consider using natural language processing libraries like NLTK to edit the transcript for readability and ease of understanding. This step involves applying various NLP techniques to improve the quality of the transcript.
    
    To improve the quality of the transcript using NLP techniques, you can utilize libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in your Django application. NLTK provides various tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, POS tagging, and more.
    
    Example code for using NLTK for basic text processing:
    
    '''
    import nltk
    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
    
    # Example text to process
    text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    
    # Tokenize the text into individual words
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Lemmatize the tokens to reduce them to their base form
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]
    
    # Print the processed tokens
    print(lemmatized_tokens)
    '''
    
    In this example, we have used NLTK to tokenize the text into words and then lemmatize the tokens to reduce them to their base form. You can explore other NLP techniques provided by NLTK and apply them as per your requirements.
    
    Please note that NLTK requires additional resources for some functionalities. You may need to download those resources using the nltk.download() function before using certain modules or functionalities.
    
    Step 8:
    
    Configure the app to display the transcript in horizontal screen mode, ensuring that it moves smoothly as a teleprompter.
    
    To display the transcript in horizontal screen mode, you can use CSS to style the teleprompter container and ensure that it moves smoothly as a teleprompter. You can set the container's width to 100% and apply CSS properties like white-space: nowrap and overflow: hidden to create the horizontal scrolling effect.
    
    Example code for horizontal screen mode styling:
    
    '''
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subby Teleprompter</title>
        <style>
            .teleprompter {
                width: 100%;
                height: 200px;
                overflow: hidden;
                white-space: nowrap;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="teleprompter" id="transcript">This is a long transcript that will scroll horizontally.</div>
    
        <script>
            // Example usage: update the transcript with new speech
            var newSpeech = 'This is the new transcription.';
            document.getElementById('transcript').textContent = newSpeech;
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''
    
    In this example, we have added CSS properties to the .teleprompter class to create the horizontal scrolling effect. The transcript text inside the <div> element will scroll horizontally within the container.
    
    Step 9: Optionally, implement a button that allows the user to quickly show a summary of the transcribed content from the last 60 seconds. This feature may involve storing and retrieving the relevant data from the transcript.
    
    To implement the button that shows a summary of the transcribed content from the last 60 seconds, you can store the transcriptions in a data structure, such as an array, and retrieve the relevant data when the button is clicked. You can use JavaScript to handle the button click event and display the summary.
    
    Example code for adding a summary button:
    
    '''
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Subby Teleprompter</title>
        <style>
            .teleprompter {
                width: 100%;
                height: 200px;
                overflow: hidden;
                white-space: nowrap;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="teleprompter" id="transcript">This is a long transcript that will scroll horizontally.</div>
    
        <button id="summary-button">Show Summary</button>
        <div id="summary"></div>
    
        <script>
            var transcriptData = [];
    
            // Function to continuously update the transcript
            function updateTranscript(transcription) {
                var transcriptDiv = document.getElementById('transcript');
                transcriptDiv.textContent = transcription;
                transcriptData.push(transcription);
            }
    
            // Function to handle the summary button click event
            function handleSummaryButtonClick() {
                var summaryDiv = document.getElementById('summary');
                var last60SecondsData = transcriptData.slice(-60).join(' ');
                summaryDiv.textContent = last60SecondsData;
            }
    
            // Example usage: update the transcript with new speech
            var newSpeech = 'This is the new transcription.';
            updateTranscript(newSpeech);
    
            // Add event listener for summary button click
            document.getElementById('summary-button').addEventListener('click', handleSummaryButtonClick);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    '''
    
    In this example, we have added a button with the id summary-button and a <div> element with the id summary. The handleSummaryButtonClick function is called when the button is clicked, and it retrieves the transcribed content from the last 60 seconds by using the slice method on the transcriptData array.
    
    Please note that in this example, we are storing the transcriptions in memory using the transcriptData array. If you want to persist the data beyond a single session or across different users, you would need to consider using a backend database or storage solution to store and retrieve the relevant data.
    
    Additionally, you can customize the summary display to suit your needs. For example, you can format the summary text or limit the number of words displayed
    
    Step 10: Consider future implementation possibilities, such as integrating a charging case with clip-on Bluetooth lavalier microphones, although this functionality is not currently available.
    
    This step encourages you to think about future enhancements to your application. One possibility mentioned is integrating a charging case with clip-on Bluetooth lavalier microphones. This functionality is not currently available, but it suggests a potential future enhancement to consider. You can explore the feasibility of integrating such functionality and plan for it in your application's architecture, if applicable.
    
    Step 11: Continuously test and improve the application to ensure it meets the needs of individuals with hearing loss and provides an effective live transcription solution.
    
    Testing and continuous improvement are crucial to ensure that your application meets the needs of individuals with hearing loss and provides an effective live transcription solution. Regular testing can help identify and fix any issues or bugs, and continuous improvement allows you to enhance the user experience and address any feedback or suggestions from users.
    
    Example code for continuous testing and improvement:
    
    📋 Copy code
    # test_transcription.py
    import unittest
    from myapp import transcribe_speech
    
    class TranscriptionTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_transcribe_speech(self):
            speech = "This is a test speech."
            transcription = transcribe_speech(speech)
            self.assertIsInstance(transcription, str)
            self.assertNotEqual(transcription, "")
            self.assertEqual(transcription, "This is the expected transcription.")
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    In this example, we have a test_transcribe_speech test case that verifies the transcribe_speech function's behavior. You can write additional test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases. Running these tests regularly will help ensure that your application is functioning correctly.
    
    To continuously improve the application, you can gather user feedback, conduct usability studies, and iterate on the features based on the feedback received. You can also monitor application performance and address any bottlenecks or issues that arise.
    
    Remember that testing and improvement are ongoing processes, and it's important to prioritize user satisfaction and accessibility in order to provide the best experience for individuals with hearing loss
